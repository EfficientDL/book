We used a bare inception model to train on the oxford flowers dataset. The dataset has 1020 training, 1020 validation and 6149 test examples. ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/480644/134114129-488002ca-37cc-41c0-9df9-d3626da4de2f.png)
It has 102 distinct flower labels. Each image is assigned a unique label.

We experimented with several data augmentation techniques. The results are described in the later sections. All the experiments are run with the following prameters unless otherwise stated:
* Base Model: Inception
* Epochs: 30
* Batch Size: 64
