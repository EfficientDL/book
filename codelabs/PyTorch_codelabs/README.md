# PyTorch Codelabs

In this directory, you can find the codelabs that have been translated from **TensorFlow** to **Pytorch** for each chapter. If you do not see the notebook you are looking for there are two possibilities:

* The notebook does not use **TensorFlow**, so it would be just a copy.

* The notebook has not been translated yet. You can wait, or maybe even translate the original by yourself. You will learn a lot and contribute to this awesome book!
